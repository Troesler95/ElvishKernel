# Micro-Kernel Project
> This is a simple micro-kernel developed as the final project in an introductory operating systems course at SUNY Fredonia. 

## Inspiration

The general _what_ about this project is to see at a deep level how a microkernel operates and manages resources for the operating system sitting on top of it. Though it is always nice to dream big, the purpose of this project is **not** for completion. The end goal is to learn as much about the low-level operations of the kernel in a two month period.
